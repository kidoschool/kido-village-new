          <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div className=\"what-info pb-3\">\n                        <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES KIDO VILLAGE COLLECT?</h3>\n                        <h5 style={{color : \"#444\"}}>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h5>\n                        <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your Kido Village Account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, birthdate, address, Aadhar and Pan card details, immunization records, occupation and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites) as well as your child(ren)’s name, birth date, and other information regarding your child(ren)’s habits, including without limitation immunization records. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your Kido Village Account, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, we may import your list of “friends” from Facebook if you sign in to the Services via your Facebook account. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>\n                        <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking on the unsubscribe option in our emails or by contacting us at support@kidovillage.com.</p>\n                       \n                        <h5 style={{color : \"#444\"}}>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h5>\n                        <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>\n                        <p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>\n                       \n                        <h5 style={{color : \"#444\"}}>INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OTHER WEBSITES AND DO NOT TRACK POLICY</h5>\n                        <p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>\n\n                        <h5 style={{color : \"#444\"}}>WILL KIDO VILLAGE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h5>\n                        <p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this below: <span style={{color : \"#444\"}}>Information that’s been de-identified.</span> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Analytics: </span>We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to grow our business, to improve and develop our Services, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, to aid our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. These services may collect and retain some information about you. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Finally, you can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Advertisers: </span>We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in Mumbai to show you ads or offers for Mumbai businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p>\n                        <p>We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Affiliated Businesses: </span>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account; for example, you may be able to automatically import your “likes” to the Services from Facebook if you sign in to the Services through Facebook. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Our Agents: </span>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and may be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section above in that regard.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>User Profiles and Submissions: </span>Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your Kido Village Account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Business Transfers: </span>We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>\n                        <p><span style={{color : \"#222\"}}>Protection of Kido Village and Others: </span>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Kido Village, our employees, our users, or others.</p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div className=\"is-personal pb-3\">\n                        <h3>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h3>\n                        <p>Your Kido Village Account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
